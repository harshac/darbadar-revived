_“Ek! Don! Teen! Char!”_{:title="One! Two! Three! Four!"}

_“Aunty, haath peeche karo na!”_{:title="Aunty, please move your hand!"} I told the woman standing behind me, although I knew it wasn't her fault that her hand was pressed against my buttocks. We were among a crowd of thousands—packed tight like honeycombs of a beehive—who had gathered on Lakshmi road to watch the Ganpati procession before _visarjan_{:title="Immersion of the Ganesha idol in a water body, thus concluding Ganesha festival that is celebrated for ten days."}.  

_“Ganpati chya jai jai kaar!”_{:title="Praise Lord Ganesha."}
 
I was standing on my toes, trying to see what the infinite wave of bobbing heads was hiding from me. I could hear it in the distance though, that sound, like a storm heading towards me.

![Crowd](){:name="crowd"}

_“Ganpati bappa moriya, pudhchya varshi lavkar yaa!”_{:title="Oh Ganesha, my lord, return soon next year!"} The place resounded with their chants.

“I can't see a thing!” I yelled at my friend Kunal, separated from me by half a dozen people on my right. But every single time drumsticks collided with synthetic skins, stretched taut over the open ends of wooden barrels—the _dhols_{:title="A cylindrical wooden drum."}—I felt it, as goosebumps drew upon my flesh, as if my skin was cackling with glee.  

_“Ek! Don! Teen! Char!”_{:title="One! Two! Three! Four!"}

![Hands](){:name="hands"}

The _dhols_{:title="A cylindrical wooden drum."} were getting louder. The heat was rising. The storm was forming its head. 

The crowds pushed. The volunteers in front, with their hands locked and forming a human chain to let the procession pass through, dangerously flirted with the _rangoli_{:title="Indian art form in which patterns are created on the ground and filled with coloured rice/flower petals/coloured sand."} that was laid out on the roads.
 
![Rangoli](){:data-src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5796/21834690210_2f5d10c7b7_c.jpg"}{:data-caption="The rangoli taking shape earlier in the day."}{:name="rangoli"}

And then I saw a glimpse, of saffron silk flags dancing in the skies as their bearers danced to the beats of the _dhol-tasha_{:title="Two commonly used drums in the procession."}, their energy rippling through the crowd. A hundred cameras flashed above the sea of heads. A push here, a shove there. 

![Flags](){:name="flags"}

I caught a glimpse of a red _bandhini_{:title="A type of tie-dye textile."} _pheta_{:title="Maharashtrian turban."} before it melted into the crowds. I saw a dimpled smile in the shadow of a pearl-encrusted _nath_{:title="A Maharashtrian nose-pin."}. I watched in awe, at those faces smeared with sweat and pride. Those finger tips wrapped in strips of white. 

The ground trembled, almost. The _pathak_{:title="A group pf people who perform together (in context of procession taken out during Ganpati visarjan)."} had come. The storm had arrived.

![Dhol](){:name="dhol1"}

The _dhols_{:title="A cylindrical wooden drum."} sounded their battle cries, their baritone broken by high-pitched clang of _taals_{:title="Pair of clash cymbals."}. The _lezims_{:title="A small musical instrument with cymbals used in a Maharashtrian folk dance."} jingled, as cymbals danced their merry dance.

There was an element of madness in their way, in the way they performed, as if in a trance. A madness that trickled down to everyone watching, as the crowds swayed to the beats, moving in tantalizing harmony, their chanting feverish.

![Tasha](){:name="dhol"}

Have you ever felt a pulsating artery? That's exactly how I felt as I watched the storm unfold. When I saw the first glimpse of the idol in the distance. When heads bowed and hands joined in reverence. When old, dilapidated buildings, crowded as they were, chanted with us - those who filled the streets below. When men and women, boys and girls performed with _dhols_{:title="A cylindrical wooden drum."} and _tashas_{:title="A kettle drum with a shallow metal body."}, their adrenaline beating the unrelenting sun. When I felt the music become one with my pulse. When I felt our collective pulse become the music.

As the music gained crescendo, so did the madness. The flags rose higher. The movements, frenetic. And such was the fervour of that moment, that even those in the crowd lost their breaths, as if they were the ones performing. 

_“Ganpati chya jai jai kaar!”_{:title="Praise Lord Ganesha."}  I screamed this time with the rest of the crowd, not feeling any different from them, not anymore. And in that moment of madness, we united. The sweat. The dirt. The joy. The juggernaut.

*A special thanks to my friend Kunal for letting me use some of his photos and also, for dragging me around like a rag-doll through busy roads and helping me watch this spectacle, which I have otherwise not had a chance to see for over a decade of staying in Pune.*
