Darbadar, a word of Farsi-Urdu origin, means door-to-door, a word we think best describes the essence of a traveler, an identity we take on sporadically.

A massive, delectable slice of life. Acidic and pungent and sweet and hot. Drips down the sides of your mouth onto your clothes. Messy but so good that you keep digging until your fork scrapes the china.

By design our stomachs are always empty.
